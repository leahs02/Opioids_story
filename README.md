Story Pitch Draft #1

For decades, the opioid epidemic was framed as a battle against addiction. We were taught to see it as a crisis of poor choices, a cautionary tale to scare us straight. But today, the enemy is no longer addiction—it's survival. The rise of fentanyl has changed the stakes, turning each encounter with the drug into a deadly gamble. Our drug education is stuck in the past, still focused on preventing addiction, while the real threat—fentanyl—silently claims lives. It's time to confront this new reality: where do we start?

# Opioids
Opioids is an all encompassing term referring to natural, semi - synthetic, and synthetic opioids. Opiates are natural opioids, which are directly derived from the extremely addictive latex of the seeds of the Papaver Somniferum, or opium poppies. Examples include heroin, morphine and codeine. Synthetic opioids are chemically made with examples including tramadol and fentanyl. Semi-synthetic opioids land in a gray area in between, kind of like GMOs. Heroin is an example of a semi-synthetic opioid because it is made from morphine, an opiate, but has been chemically processed. Other examples of semi-synthetic opioids include oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone.

# The Evolution of the Epidemic

Let us consider for a moment, the nature of the Opioid Epidemic. We call the complicated history of prescription opioids in the US an epidemic because it embodies the true nature of an epidemic: it is evolutionary in behavior. 
Although this ability to evolve is most commonly thought of as part of biological theory with things like mutation and natural selection, this epidemic is actually the same.

At conception, the focus of the epidemic was on the over prescription of oxycodone. The risks were not made public and were unknown by patients. People were unknowingly becoming addicted. Often prescription addictions would quickly turn into addition of street drugs. The issue was addiction.

Then the epidemic evolved. The risks of opioids became better known and laws were passed to limit prescriptions and access to pills. The epidemic became less chaotic and illusive. People could now point to the source: addition. The war on drugs propaganda received a second wave. People found doing drugs were blamed for their addiction, those who needed help were instead ostracized. Parents were told to keep their medicine cabinets locked and the D.A.R.E. curriculum raved in schools. 

Now, we enter into the fourth decade of the Opioid Epidemic. Once again, it has evolved. Addiction was last generation's problem—ours is fentanyl. People no longer have the luxury of addiction: they are just dying, and we can’t treat people for addiction unless they come to recovery treatment alive. However, our legislature has been slow to adopt this understanding. Still, so much of our current curriculum for drug education is about preventative measures of addiction—which is now out to date—, so much money is being put into telling kids not to take their parents' pills. The irony here is that at least the parent’s pills aren’t going to have fentanyl in them.
